Day 1:
A big fat NOTHING for ideas today! Brainstormed for a bit with Paul and Jon. All of my ideas are TERRIBLE (a game about palindromes, really?!), but you always gotta blow through the bad ones first. So... progress??!

The only real work I did today was create the GitHub project and slap a skeleton setup in there (a copy of the tk framework I made last week: <a href="https://github.com/regularkid/tk">here</a>). It doesn't do much of anything other than provide a game loop, let you check input, play sfx (thanks <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a>!), and draw stuff. No frills or anything fancy, but for a "micro" game it'll be plenty :)

Hope to get some inspiration tomorrow!

Progress:
