Day 4:
Today was all about rope physics! I got the bare minimum implemented and it's already sort of addicting - I keep throwing the plug just to watch the rope... that's a good sign! Needed to get back up to speed on Verlet integration (it's been a while!), but there are a bunch of great tutorials out there: <links>. It's pretty awesome that such little code results in "rope physics" :)

The rest of the day was some code cleanup on plug "state management" and the addition of a quick and dirty 2D vector class (easier than manually doing math all over the place, plus this will help reduce the final code size).

Progress:
